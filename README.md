The repository's README.md file is a place where anyone new to the project can find high level information about the project, instructions for new developers on how to get started developing, or install the application.

In addition to README.md, other community health documentation can be added at the organization level or in their user account. GitHub supports the following community health documentation:
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* CONTRIBUTING.md
* FUNDING.md
* Issue and pull request templates and config.yml
* SECURITY.md
* SUPPORT.md

GitHub considers files of these types to have specific purpose, and requires you to follow the listed naming scheme when creating or updating them.

GitHub will use and display these default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

* repository root folder
* _.github_ folder
* _docs_ folder
